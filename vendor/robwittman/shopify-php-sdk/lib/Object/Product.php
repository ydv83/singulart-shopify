 * A product is an individual item for sale in a Shopify store. Products are often
 * physical, but they don't have to be. For example, a digital download (such as a
 * movie, music or ebook file) also qualifies as a product, as do services (such as
 * equipment rental, work for hire, customization of another product or an extended
 * warranty). Simply put: if it's something for sale in a store, then it's a product.
