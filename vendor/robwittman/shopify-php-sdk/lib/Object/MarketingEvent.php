 *
 * Marketing events represent actions taken by your app, on behalf of a merchant,
 * to market products, collections, discounts, pages, blog posts, the homepage, etc.
 *
 * Marketing events should represent actions that target multiple potential customers,
 * because theyâ€™re intended to aggregate traffic, etc. For example, if your app
 * sends emails to customers, do not create a different marketing event for each
 * individual who is emailed; create a marketing event for a related set of emails.
