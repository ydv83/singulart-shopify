 *
 * Webhooks are a useful tool for apps that want to execute code after a specific
 * event happens on a shop, for example, after a customer creates a cart on the
 * storefront, or a merchant creates a new product in their admin.
 *
 * Instead of telling your app to make an API call every X number of minutes to check
 * if a specific event has occured on a shop, you can register webhooks, which
 * send an HTTP request from the shop telling your app that the event has occurred.
 * This uses many less API requests overall, allowing you to build more robust apps,
 * and update your app instantly after a webhook is received.
 *
 * Webhooks are scoped to the app they're registered to. This means that when a
 * webhook is registered to an app, other apps can't view, modify, or delete it.
