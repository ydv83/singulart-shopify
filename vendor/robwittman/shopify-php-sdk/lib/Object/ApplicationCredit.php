 *
 * If a merchant requests a refund for an application charge, you can use ApplicationCredit
 * to credit their account for future application purchases. Request to create an application
 * charge credit for a particular amount along with a description explaining why the credit
 * is being issued. A corresponding deduction based on your revenue share will appear in your
 * partner account. For example, if you request to create a credit for $10.00, a deduction
 * of $8.00 will be applied.
 *
 * The total amount of all ApplicationCredit objects requested by an application must not exceed:
 *  - Total amount paid to the application by the shop owner in the last 30 days.
 *  - Total amount of pending receivables in the partner account associated with the application.
